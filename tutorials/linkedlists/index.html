    <p class="tutorial_tittle">Linked Lists</p>
    <p class="tutorial_text">
        Welcome to the first tutorial about data structures! 
        In this tutorial we are going to learn about Linked Lists, one of the most basic 
        computer science data structure, but this does not mean that is not useful.
        <br><br>
        For starting this lesson we first need to understand how plain arrays really work,
        if you are new to programming, this may seem like magic to you, but is a very 
        simple and fundamental concept to cs.

        As you can see, internally is a adjacent sequence of bytes, were one sits 
        in front of each other.
        When you have a code like this:<br>
        <code>
            arr = [1,2,3,4,5] <br>
            print(arr[0]) <br>
            print(arr[1]) <br>
            print(arr[3]) <br>
        </code>
        The variable "arr" is not storing the whole array, it is storing a pointer or
        reference to the first element in the array (to the memory allocation of the first element)
        when wee type arr[0] we are accesing the addres of the first element + offset , 
        where offset is the difference (idx - 0), in this case is : location + sizeof(data stored) * 0,
        if we are trying to access the idx 3, were accesing location + sizeof(data stored) * 3,
        and with these were accesing the exact memory allocation were our desired data is stored.
        <br>
        Okey, now knowing that we can continue to linked lists, 
        weve seen that in plain arrays we are accesing the next element knowing the memory allocation of the previous,
        and we can access randomly all the array, this is the main difference, in linked lists each node is not adjacent, and 
        we can't do this operations, instead, each node of a linked list have the information to the next node,
        for example: <br>
        <b>
            [1,2,3,4,5] whill be: [1, location of(2)], [2, location of(3)], [3, location of(4)], [4, location of(5)], [5, no next node]
        </b> 
        <br>
        <br>
        With this were are losing random access, for accesing the idx 3 we need to go first in idx 0, 1, 2 for searching the idx 3,
        but we have some advantages over arrays:
        <br>
    </p>
    <div class="tutorial_list">
        <li>
            <ul>Dinamic memory growth (the linked list can grow easily)</ul>
            <ul>Insert first and Insert last operations run in constant O(1) time</ul>
        </li>
    </div>

    <br> 
    <p class="tutorial_text">And some disadvantages : </p>
    <div class="tutorial_list">
        <li>
            <ul>No random access</ul>
            <ul>If wee know how much memory wee need less efficient</ul>
        </li>
    </div>
